/**
 * 主题的删除是有个过程的，这里主管整个过程的处理
 * This manages the state machine for topic deletion.
 * 1. TopicCommand issues topic deletion by creating a new admin path /admin/delete_topics/<topic>
 * 2. The controller listens for child changes on /admin/delete_topic and starts topic deletion for the respective topics
 * 3. The controller's ControllerEventThread handles topic deletion. A topic will be ineligible
 *    for deletion in the following scenarios -
  *   3.1 broker hosting one of the replicas for that topic goes down
  *   3.2 partition reassignment for partitions of that topic is in progress
 * 4. Topic deletion is resumed when -
 *    4.1 broker hosting one of the replicas for that topic is started
 *    4.2 partition reassignment for partitions of that topic completes
 * 5. Every replica for a topic being deleted is in either of the 3 states -
 *    5.1 TopicDeletionStarted Replica enters TopicDeletionStarted phase when onPartitionDeletion is invoked.
 *        This happens when the child change watch for /admin/delete_topics fires on the controller. As part of this state
 *        change, the controller sends StopReplicaRequests to all replicas. It registers a callback for the
 *        StopReplicaResponse when deletePartition=true thereby invoking a callback when a response for delete replica
 *        is received from every replica)
 *    5.2 TopicDeletionSuccessful moves replicas from
 *        TopicDeletionStarted->TopicDeletionSuccessful depending on the error codes in StopReplicaResponse
 *    5.3 TopicDeletionFailed moves replicas from
 *        TopicDeletionStarted->TopicDeletionFailed depending on the error codes in StopReplicaResponse.
 *        In general, if a broker dies and if it hosted replicas for topics being deleted, the controller marks the
 *        respective replicas in TopicDeletionFailed state in the onBrokerFailure callback. The reason is that if a
 *        broker fails before the request is sent and after the replica is in TopicDeletionStarted state,
 *        it is possible that the replica will mistakenly remain in TopicDeletionStarted state and topic deletion
 *        will not be retried when the broker comes back up.
 * 6. A topic is marked successfully deleted only if all replicas are in TopicDeletionSuccessful
 *    state. Topic deletion teardown mode deletes all topic state from the controllerContext
 *    as well as from zookeeper. This is the only time the /brokers/topics/<topic> path gets deleted. On the other hand,
 *    if no replica is in TopicDeletionStarted state and at least one replica is in TopicDeletionFailed state, then
 *    it marks the topic for deletion retry.
